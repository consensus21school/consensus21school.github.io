## Core Principles

### Self-Directed Learning
- Students choose what, how, and when they want to learn, with guidance available from facilitators (not traditional teachers).
- Learning is driven by curiosity and personal interests rather than a predefined syllabus.

### Play as Central to Development
- Ample time for free, unstructured play, which is seen as vital for cognitive, social, and emotional growth.
- Play includes physical, imaginative, social, and intellectual activities.

### Mixed-Age Learning Communities
- Students of different ages learn and interact together, fostering mentorship, collaboration, and empathy.
- Older students can guide younger ones, and everyone benefits from diverse perspectives.

### Democratic Governance
- Students and staff participate equally in decision-making about school rules, schedules, and activities.
- A school meeting system ensures that all voices are heard and respected.

### Real-World Connections
- Opportunities for hands-on, experiential learning through projects, internships, and community involvement.
- Emphasis on practical skills and real-world problem-solving.

## Daily Schedule

### Flexible Structure
- No rigid timetable; students create their own schedules based on interests and goals.

### Blocks of Time for Exploration
- Large portions of the day are dedicated to self-chosen activities, whether it's reading, building, creating art, coding, or engaging in physical play.

### Community Time
- Daily meetings where students and staff discuss school matters, share ideas, and resolve conflicts collaboratively.

## Learning Areas (Non-Traditional Approach)

### Play-Based Exploration
- Open-ended resources like blocks, art supplies, and nature materials encourage creativity and experimentation.
- Games and sports for physical and social development.

### Interest-Driven Academics
- Access to books, online resources, and mentors in areas like math, science, literature, and history.
- No compulsory tests or grades; progress is assessed through self-reflection, portfolios, and peer feedback.

### Creative Arts and Expression
- Emphasis on music, drama, visual arts, and creative writing as forms of self-expression.
- Opportunities for group projects, performances, and exhibitions.

### STEM Through Curiosity
- Hands-on projects like building robots, conducting experiments, or exploring coding.
- Learning math and science concepts naturally as they arise in real-world contexts.

### Life Skills and Practical Knowledge
- Workshops on cooking, budgeting, gardening, or fixing things.
- Focus on emotional intelligence, communication, and conflict resolution.

### Outdoor and Nature-Based Learning
- Learning through exploration of natural environments, fostering a connection to the world around us.
