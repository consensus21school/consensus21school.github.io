TSOBTC → Consensus21.School

We have consolidated all our programs, resources, and community under one banner. This transition strengthens our commitment to decentralised, value-for-value education. Key initiatives like the DAES, Plan B Network, and the ~Education Territory on Stacker News will continue, now fully integrated into Consensus21.School.
