At the Beechworth Bitcoin Bush Bash, we spotlighted our innovative project to establish a Bitcoin-powered school designed to offer an alternative to traditional education.

Our vision is to create a curriculum that encourages kids to be themselves while fostering entrepreneurial spirit, critical thinking, financial literacy, health, and sustainability â€” skills essential for thriving in the modern world.

What makes this initiative unique is its funding through Bitcoin donations, which will help maintain its independence and align with the values of the Bitcoin community. The team has released a whitepaper outlining their vision and invites feedback from attendees.
