"Blockstream have made a significant contribution to Bitcoin-aligned education by donating 21 Blockstream Jade hardware wallets to the first cohort of students at Consensus21 School’s Mornington Peninsula campus. This pioneering initiative, founded by Kieran Nolan, will place cutting-edge Bitcoin tools directly into the hands of learners as young as five, supporting a curriculum rooted in freedom tech, self-custody, and decentralization. The gesture marks a powerful alignment between the Bitcoin builder community and the next generation of sovereign learners."
