We’re excited to share that Consensus21.school Peninsula will launch as a Global Village Learning (GVL) campus powered by the Consensus21 protocol. This unique partnership combines GVL’s proven educational systems and compliance framework with the innovation of the Consensus21 protocol, creating a scalable, future-focused model for learning. We are also proud to confirm Peter Hutton as Principal. With more than 30 years of experience transforming schools and empowering learner agency, Peter brings both visionary leadership and practical expertise to guide this pioneering campus. Alongside these milestones, we have advanced our investment discussions, including a constructive meeting with Ego Death Capital, with follow-up steps now underway. Consensus21.school Peninsula will stand as the world’s first GVL campus powered by the Consensus21 protocol, demonstrating how education can be decentralised, financially sustainable, and globally scalable.
